/**
 * Guided first-run setup.
 *
 *   pnpm setup
 *
 * Validates required environment variables, runs database migrations, and
 * seeds the default ticket statuses & categories.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT create the first admin — that's a separate,
 * explicit step (`pnpm create:admin`) run by hand so you get immediate,
 * visible success/failure feedback right in your terminal, instead of it
 * happening silently inside a detached `docker compose up -d` service
 * where a failure could easily go unnoticed.
 *
 * Safe to re-run: migrations and seeds are idempotent.

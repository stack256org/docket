# Authentication

## Overview

Docket has two completely separate authentication flows:

| Actor | Flow | Login Required |
|-------|------|----------------|
| Customer | No account. Name + email on ticket form. Access tickets via secure email link. | No |
| Agent | Full Better Auth session via magic link or Google OAuth | Yes |
| Admin | Full Better Auth session via magic link or Google OAuth | Yes |

Customers are never redirected to the agent login page. Agents and admins are never shown the customer portal without a valid session.

---

## 1. Customer Access (No Login)

Customers do not create an account or set a password. They identify themselves by providing their **name and email** when submitting a ticket.

### Creating a Ticket

1. Customer visits `/` (public — no auth required).
2. Fills in: Full Name, Email Address, Subject, Description, Category, optional file attachments.
3. Submits the form.
4. System creates the ticket and sends a **confirmation email** to the provided address containing:
   - Ticket number and subject
   - A **secure ticket link** valid indefinitely: `/ticket/{ticketId}?token={ticketToken}`
   - A link to view all their tickets: `/my-tickets` (prompts for email, sends an access link)

### Accessing a Ticket

- Customer clicks the link in their email.
- The `ticketToken` is validated against the DB (`ticket.customer_token`).
- If valid: the ticket detail page is shown — no session created.
- If invalid/missing: show an error page with a link to request a new access email.

The `ticketToken` is a cuid2 generated at ticket creation time and stored in the `ticket` row. It never expires. Customers can bookmark the link.

### Viewing All Tickets

If a customer wants to see all tickets they have submitted:

1. They go to `/my-tickets`.
2. They enter their email address.
3. The system sends an email with links to all open tickets for that email (the individual per-ticket secure links, not a session).
4. No session is created — each link navigates to the individual ticket detail.

This is not a traditional "login" — it is simply a convenience email listing their tickets.

### Security for Customer Access

- `ticket.customer_token` is never exposed in any agent/admin API response.
- A customer can only access a ticket via its token — they cannot guess or enumerate other ticket IDs.
- Internal notes (`is_internal = true`) are always stripped from customer-facing API responses server-side.
- The "view all tickets" email only sends ticket links for the requesting email address — never for other customers.

## 2. Agent & Admin Login (Better Auth)

Agents and admins authenticate via Better Auth with three supported methods:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Email & Password | Agent enters email + password → session created immediately. Works with **zero external dependencies** — no SMTP, no OAuth provider — which is why it's the recommended bootstrap path for a fresh self-hosted install. |
| Magic Link | Agent enters email → receives a one-time sign-in link → clicks it → session created. Requires SMTP to be configured (`lib/email`). |
| Google OAuth | Agent clicks "Sign in with Google" → OAuth flow → session created. Requires a Client ID / Secret, set from **Admin → Integrations** or `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` (see `lib/integration-settings.ts`). |

There is **no public self-registration** for any method — a user account only ever comes into existence via the first-run setup wizard (`/setup`, see below), `pnpm create:admin` (script), an admin promoting an existing magic-link/Google sign-up (`pnpm make:admin` or the admin panel), or an admin adding them from `/admin/users` (see "Adding a New Agent/Admin" below). Password accounts are never created by an open sign-up form.

### First-Run Setup (`/setup`)

On a brand-new install (no admin user exists yet), the operator does **not** need to run a CLI command — the app serves a guided setup wizard so the first admin can be created from the browser:

1. Any visit to `/` or `/login` redirects to `/setup` while no admin exists (see the `isSetupComplete()` guard in `lib/setup.ts` — "setup is complete" ≡ "at least one `admin` user exists").
2. The wizard (`app/(setup)/setup`) collects a color theme + appearance in step 1 (live preview via `ThemeProvider`) and the admin's name / email / password in step 2.
3. `POST /api/setup` creates the admin (via `createAdminUser` in `lib/bootstrap-admin.ts`, the same path as `pnpm create:admin`), seeds default statuses/categories/priorities (`lib/seed-defaults.ts`), and persists the chosen theme to `platform_settings`.
4. The wizard auto-signs-in with the just-created credentials, then step 3 offers optional SMTP / Google OAuth / Pusher Beams / Pusher Channels / storage setup (same forms as **Admin → Integrations**, skippable and revisitable any time — see `lib/integration-settings.ts`) before landing on `/dashboard`.

**Security:** `POST /api/setup` and the `/setup` page are intentionally unauthenticated (there's no admin to authenticate as yet) but **self-disabling** — both check `isSetupComplete()` and return `403` / redirect to `/login` the moment an admin exists, so the bootstrap path can never be replayed to mint a second admin on a live install. `pnpm create:admin` remains available as a CLI alternative.

### Sign-In Method Toggles

An admin can enable/disable each method at runtime from **`/admin/appearance`** (stored in `platform_settings`: `passwordLoginEnabled`, `magicLinkEnabled`, `googleLoginEnabled`). Fresh install default: only `passwordLoginEnabled` is `true` — matches `pnpm create:admin` being the zero-dependency bootstrap path (no SMTP/OAuth required to get in the door). An admin opts into magic link and/or Google afterward once SMTP/OAuth credentials are actually configured. This is enforced **server-side**, not just hidden in the UI: `lib/auth.ts` registers a `hooks.before` middleware that rejects `/sign-in/email`, `/sign-in/magic-link`, and `/sign-in/social` requests when the corresponding toggle is off, so a disabled method can't be used by calling the API directly. The settings UI (and the API route backing it) refuses to let all three be disabled at once — at least one method must always remain reachable.

Google's toggle only controls whether the *configured* provider is offered — turning it on without a Client ID/Secret set (via Integrations or env) does nothing (the switch is disabled in the UI in that case). Google credentials are resolved once, at process startup (`lib/auth.ts` reads `getGoogleOAuthSettings()` via a top-level `await`, since Better Auth builds `socialProviders` synchronously) — unlike every other integration, saving new Google credentials from Admin → Integrations needs an app restart (`docker compose restart app`) before sign-in picks them up, even though the UI reflects the saved value immediately.

**Credential verification:** the SMTP and Google Sign-in cards on Admin → Integrations don't just check that the fields are non-empty. A "Test connection" button runs a real check on demand (SMTP: `nodemailer`'s `transporter.verify()` — a full connect + auth handshake with no mail sent; Google: an OAuth token exchange with a deliberately invalid code, whose error tells apart a bad client ID/secret pair from a bad code — see `lib/integration-test.ts`), and the same check runs automatically on every Save. The result (`{host,google}LastTestedAt/Ok/Error` on `integration_settings`) drives the badge: "Not configured" → "Configured" (saved, never tested) → "Verified `<relative time>`" or "Needs attention" (saved but the last check failed, with the server's error shown inline). For Google, "Verified" only means the credentials themselves are valid — the running server still needs a restart to pick them up, per the note above.

### Sign-In Flow

1. Agent/admin visits `/login`.
2. Chooses a method from whichever are currently enabled: password, magic link, or Google OAuth. When both password and magic link are enabled, a small link lets them switch between the two.
3. **Password:** Submits email + password → session created immediately, redirected to `/post-auth`.
4. **Magic link:** Always shows: `"If this email is valid, a sign-in link has been sent."` regardless of whether the email exists (prevents account enumeration).
5. **Google OAuth:** Redirects to Google → returns to the app → session created.
6. On success: redirected to `/dashboard` (via `/post-auth`).
7. On failure: password shows `"Invalid email or password."`; an expired/invalid magic link shows `"This link has expired or has already been used. Request a new one."` with a link back to `/login`.

### Password Rules

- Minimum **8 characters** (`emailAndPassword.minPasswordLength` in `lib/auth.ts`).
- Hashed and stored by Better Auth in the `account` table (`provider_id = 'credential'`) — the app never handles raw password hashing itself.
- `requireEmailVerification` is off — self-hosted installs may not have SMTP configured, so password sign-in must not depend on receiving an email.
- **Self-service reset:** `/forgot-password` → email + Better Auth's `sendResetPassword` (`lib/auth.ts`) sends a link via `resetPasswordTemplate` → `/reset-password?token=...` sets a new password. Same generic-success-message anti-enumeration pattern as magic link. Reset link expires in **1 hour**, single-use (Better Auth's `verification` table). Blocked entirely (`403`) if `passwordLoginEnabled` is off — there's nothing to reset into.
- **Admin-initiated reset:** an admin can directly set a new password for any user from **`/admin/users`** ("Reset Password") — no old password required, no email sent. Backed by Better Auth's admin plugin (`auth.api.setUserPassword`, `PATCH /api/users/[id]` with `{ password }`). Hidden when `passwordLoginEnabled` is off (nothing to reset into). Logged via `user.password_set_by_admin` in the audit log.

### Adding a New Agent/Admin

An admin can add a new agent/admin from **`/admin/users`** ("Add User") instead of requiring `pnpm create:admin` for every account — `POST /api/users` (admin only). This is the **only** way to create an agent/admin account from the app; there is no email-invite flow.

1. Admin enters name, email, role (agent/admin), and the new user's password, then submits.
2. A `user` row is created (`emailVerified: true`), then the password is set via Better Auth's admin plugin (`auth.api.setUserPassword`). If setting the password fails, the `user` row is rolled back so no password-less account is left behind.
3. **No email is sent.** The admin passes the password to the new user out of band; the user signs in at `/login` like anyone else, and can change it from their profile afterwards.
4. Password sign-in must be enabled — the route returns `403` when `passwordLoginEnabled` is off, and the dialog shows a pointer to `/admin/appearance` instead of the form.

### Magic Link Rules

- Valid for **15 minutes**.
- Single-use — invalidated immediately after the session is created.
- If a new link is requested while a previous one is valid, the old link is invalidated.
- Rate limited: max **5 requests** per email per 15 minutes (Better Auth built-in).

### Session Rules

- Database-backed sessions (stored in `session` table).
- Default TTL: **7 days** with sliding expiry — TTL resets on each authenticated request.
- A deactivated user's sessions are revoked immediately by the Better Auth Admin Plugin.
- 60-second cookie cache (`session.cookieCache` in `lib/auth.ts`) to skip a DB round-trip on most requests — trusts a signed cookie blob for up to 60s without re-checking the DB. Sign-out (`app/actions/auth.ts`) calls `auth.api.signOut()` directly from a Server Action rather than through the HTTP route, which needs Better Auth's `nextCookies()` plugin (last in the `plugins` array in `lib/auth.ts`) to actually forward the resulting cookie-clearing headers to the browser — without it, the DB session is deleted correctly but the browser keeps a still-valid cache cookie for up to 60s, so the user appears to stay signed in until it expires on its own.

---

## 3. Roles

Roles are stored in `user.role`:

| Role | Value | How it is assigned |
|------|-------|--------------------|
| Agent | `agent` | Admin assigns in admin panel |
| Admin | `admin` | `pnpm make:admin email@...` or promoted in admin panel |

There is no `customer` role — customers are not users in the system. They are identified only by the email stored on each ticket.

New users who sign in via magic link or Google for the first time are auto-created with no meaningful role (`user`, the DB column default) and cannot access the agent portal until an admin assigns the `agent` or `admin` role. Password accounts don't go through this path at all — they're only ever created via `pnpm create:admin`, the setup wizard, or "Add User" in the admin panel, all of which set the role directly at creation time, so there's no "unassigned password user" state to worry about.

---

## 4. Better Auth Admin Plugin

The Better Auth Admin Plugin gives platform admins additional capabilities:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Ban user | Revokes all sessions. User cannot sign in. Surfaced in the admin UI as **Deactivate** — see `docs/admin-portal.md`. |
| Unban user | Restores sign-in access. Surfaced as **Reactivate**. |
| Impersonate user | Admin logs in as any user for support. Opens a separate session. |
| Revoke sessions | Revoke any user's sessions individually or all at once. |

These are accessible via the Orbit panel at `/orbit`.

---

## 5. Route Protection

| Route | Guard |
|-------|-------|
| `/` and `/ticket/*` | Public — no auth. Customer token validated per-request for ticket pages. |
| `/my-tickets` | Public — validates by email then sends link. |
| `/login` | Public — redirect to `/dashboard` if already signed in. |
| `/dashboard`, `/tickets/*` (agent) | Requires session with `role: agent` or `role: admin`. |
| `/admin/*` | Requires session with `role: admin`. |
| `/orbit/*` | Requires session with `role: admin`. |

---

## 6. API Auth Pattern

### Agent/Admin API Routes

Every agent/admin API route checks the session first:

```typescript
const session = await auth.api.getSession({ headers: await headers() })
if (!session) return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 })
if (!['agent', 'admin'].includes(session.user.role)) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Forbidden' }, { status: 403 })
}
```

### Customer API Routes

Customer-facing routes (e.g. posting a reply on a ticket) validate the customer token:

```typescript
const token = searchParams.get('token')
const ticket = await db.query.tickets.findFirst({
  where: and(eq(tickets.id, ticketId), eq(tickets.customerToken, token))
})
if (!ticket) return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Not found' }, { status: 404 })
```

## 7. Data Model (Auth Tables)

Managed by Better Auth:

```
user
+-- id                text PK (cuid2)
+-- email             text unique
+-- name              text
+-- email_verified    boolean default false
+-- image             text (avatar storage key, nullable)
+-- role              text  ← 'agent' | 'admin' | 'user' (DB default — no portal access)
+-- banned            boolean default false  ← surfaced as "deactivated" in the UI
+-- ban_reason        text nullable
+-- ban_expires       timestamp nullable
+-- created_at        timestamp
+-- updated_at        timestamp

session
+-- id                text PK
+-- user_id           text → user.id (cascade delete)
+-- token             text unique
+-- expires_at        timestamp
+-- ip_address        text nullable
+-- user_agent        text nullable
+-- impersonated_by   text nullable
+-- created_at / updated_at

account
+-- id                text PK
+-- user_id           text → user.id (cascade delete)
+-- provider_id       text  ← 'google' | 'magic-link' | 'credential' (password)
+-- account_id        text
+-- password           text nullable ← hashed password, only set for provider_id = 'credential'
+-- created_at / updated_at

verification
+-- id                text PK
+-- identifier        text  ← email address
+-- value             text  ← hashed magic link token
+-- expires_at        timestamp (15 min from creation)
+-- created_at

platform_settings (db/schema/settings.ts — not a Better Auth table)
+-- id                        text PK, always 'default' (single row)
+-- password_login_enabled    boolean default true
+-- magic_link_enabled        boolean default true
+-- google_login_enabled      boolean default true
+-- ...theme / appearance_mode (unrelated to auth, see docs/design-system.md)
```

## 8. Security Notes

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|-----------|
| Customer ticket enumeration | Per-ticket cuid2 token in URL — not guessable |
| Internal notes leak | Stripped server-side before any customer response |
| Magic link abuse | Rate limit: 5 requests per 15 min per email |
| Email enumeration | Magic link always returns same response |
| Session hijacking | Database-backed sessions; token hashed in DB |
| CSRF | Better Auth handles CSRF on all POST routes |
| Token reuse | Magic links are single-use |
| Deactivated users | Sessions revoked immediately on deactivation |
| Disabled sign-in methods bypassed via direct API call | `lib/auth.ts`'s `hooks.before` middleware rejects `/sign-in/email`, `/sign-in/magic-link`, `/sign-in/social`, `/request-password-reset`, `/reset-password` server-side when the matching `platform_settings` toggle is off — not just a hidden UI button |
| Password brute-forcing | Better Auth's built-in rate limiting (on by default in production); 8-character minimum |
| Locking out all sign-in | The settings API and UI both refuse to disable the last remaining enabled method |
| Reset link abuse | Rate limited like magic link; single-use; 1-hour expiry; same generic response whether or not the email exists |
| Password-setup link guessing | Token minted the same unguessable way as customer ticket tokens (`createId()`, cuid2) — see `lib/password-setup-token.ts` |

## Out of Scope (MVP)

- Public self-registration for any method (accounts are always script- or admin-created)
- Customer accounts with passwords
- 2FA / TOTP
- SSO / SAML

# Public API

Docket exposes a small REST API so your own website's backend can
create tickets without sending customers through the customer portal form.

> **Interactive docs & machine-readable contract.** Admins get an
> interactive reference (rendered by Scalar, with a built-in "Test Request"
> client) at `/admin/api-keys/docs`. The canonical contract is the OpenAPI
> 3.1 spec in `lib/openapi-spec.ts`, downloadable at
> `GET /api/admin/api-keys/openapi` — import it into Postman or any other
> API tooling. There's also a ready-to-use Postman collection (hand-authored,
> in `app/api/admin/api-keys/postman/route.ts`), pre-filled with this
> instance's URL, downloadable from `/admin/api-keys` ("Postman Collection")
> or `GET /api/admin/api-keys/postman`. When the API changes, update the
> spec, this document, and the Postman collection together.

This is a **server-to-server** API: your backend calls it with a secret API
key. Don't call it directly from a customer's browser — the key would be
exposed to anyone who opens your page's network tab.

## Authentication

Generate a key from `/admin/api-keys` (admin only). You'll see the raw key
exactly once, at creation — copy it somewhere safe immediately. Support
Tool only ever stores a hash of it, so it can't be shown to you again; if
you lose it, revoke it and create a new one.

Send it as a bearer token on every request:

```
Authorization: Bearer dk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

A missing, invalid, or revoked key gets a `401`.

## Rate limits

Per API key: **100 ticket creations/min** (`POST /tickets`), **60
replies/min** (`POST /tickets/:id/comments`), **60 status changes/min**
(`PATCH /tickets/:id/status`). Read-only endpoints (`GET /config`,
`GET /tickets`, `GET /tickets/:id`, `GET /tickets/:id/comments`,
`GET /tickets/:id/attachments/:attachmentId`) aren't rate-limited. A `429`
means you've hit a write limit — back off and retry after a moment.

## Errors

Every error response is `{ "error": "<message>" }` with an appropriate HTTP
status (`400` validation, `401` auth, `404` not found, `429` rate limited,
`500` server error).

---

## `GET /api/v1/config`

The current valid category, priority, and status slugs, plus the shared tag
pool — fetch this once (cache it) to build a ticket form or interpret a
`status` value, instead of hardcoding slugs an admin could rename or reorder
later. `categories`/`priorities`/`statuses` are pre-sorted in display order
(the same order agents see in the app); `tags` is alphabetical.

```bash
curl https://support.example.com/api/v1/config \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

**Response** — `200 OK`:

```json
{
  "categories": [{ "slug": "bug", "label": "Bug", "color": "red" }],
  "priorities": [
    { "slug": "normal", "label": "Normal", "color": "slate", "isDefault": true }
  ],
  "statuses": [
    {
      "slug": "open",
      "label": "Open",
      "color": "blue",
      "isDefault": true,
      "isClosedState": false
    }
  ],
  "customFields": [
    {
      "key": "order_id",
      "label": "Order ID",
      "type": "text",
      "required": false
    },
    {
      "key": "plan",
      "label": "Plan",
      "type": "select",
      "options": ["Free", "Pro", "Enterprise"],
      "required": true
    }
  ],
  "tags": [{ "id": "ckt1a2b3c4d5e6f", "name": "billing" }]
}
```

`customFields` lists whatever an admin has configured at `/admin/custom-fields`
(empty array if none). `type` is one of `text`, `number`, `date`, `checkbox`,
`select`; `options` is only present for `select`.

`tags` is the shared tag pool agents pick from when tagging a ticket
(empty array if none exist yet) — alphabetical, not display-ordered, since
tags have no admin-defined order.

## `POST /api/v1/tickets`

Create a ticket.

**Body** (JSON):

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | Yes | Customer's name, 2–100 characters |
| `email` | Yes | Customer's email |
| `subject` | Yes | 5–200 characters |
| `description` | Yes | 10–5000 characters (counted after formatting is stripped), see note below |
| `descriptionFormat` | No | `"text"` (default) or `"html"` |
| `category` | Yes | Must match a category slug configured in `/admin/ticket-config` |
| `priority` | No | Must match a priority slug if given; falls back to the platform's default priority |
| `customFields` | No | `{ "<key>": <value> }` map — see below |
| `attachments` | No | Array of base64-encoded files — see below |

> **Attachments.** Send an array of `{ filename, mimeType, data }`, where
> `data` is the raw file content base64-encoded (no `data:` URL prefix —
> just the base64 string). Up to 5 files per ticket, 10 MB each. Allowed
> `mimeType`s: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `application/pdf`,
> `application/zip`, `text/plain` — the same limits the customer portal
> itself enforces. More files can be added later via
> `POST /api/v1/tickets/:id/comments`, up to the same 5-per-ticket cap
> (existing attachments count against it).
>
> ```json
> "attachments": [
>   {
>     "filename": "screenshot.png",
>     "mimeType": "image/png",
>     "data": "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSU..."
>   }
> ]
> ```

> **Custom fields.** Admins can define extra fields at `/admin/custom-fields`
> (text, number, date, checkbox, or select) — fetch `GET /api/v1/config` to
> see what's configured. Send matching values as a flat object keyed by each
> field's `key`: strings for `text`/`date` (date as `YYYY-MM-DD`), a number
> for `number`, `true`/`false` for `checkbox`, and one of the field's
> `options` for `select`. **Required fields are only enforced if you include
> the `customFields` object at all** — omit it entirely and ticket creation
> proceeds without touching custom fields (so adding a required field later
> never breaks an integration that doesn't know about it yet); include it
> and any required field left out returns a `400`.

> **Editor-agnostic by design.** Ticket descriptions are rich text
> internally (same as replies), but you don't need to speak our internal
> format to submit one. Send plain text (the default), or set
> `descriptionFormat: "html"` and send whatever your own editor exports —
> Quill, TipTap, TinyMCE, CKEditor, Lexical, Slate, all of them can export
> HTML. We convert it server-side, safely: your HTML is parsed strictly
> through Docket's own schema, so any tag or attribute it doesn't
> recognize (scripts, event handlers, unknown elements) is simply dropped,
> never stored or trusted as-is. If your form is a plain textarea, just
> send plain text — no conversion needed either way.

```bash
curl -X POST https://support.example.com/api/v1/tickets \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "subject": "Cannot log in",
    "description": "I get an error when I try to sign in.",
    "category": "bug",

```

```js
// Plain text (default) — descriptionFormat omitted
await fetch("https://support.example.com/api/v1/tickets", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer dk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: "Jane Doe",
    email: "jane@example.com",
    subject: "Cannot log in",
    description: "I get an error when I try to sign in.",
    category: "bug",
  }),
});

// HTML from your own editor
await fetch("https://support.example.com/api/v1/tickets", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer dk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: "Jane Doe",
    email: "jane@example.com",
    subject: "Cannot log in",
    description: "<p>I get an error when I try to sign in.</p><p><strong>It started this morning.</strong></p>",
    descriptionFormat: "html",
    category: "bug",
  }),
});
```

**Response** — `201 Created`:

```json
{
  "id": "cku1a2b3c4d5e6f",
  "ticketNumber": 1042,
  "status": "open",
  "portalUrl": "https://support.example.com/ticket/cku1a2b3c4d5e6f?token=..."
}
```

The customer also gets the standard confirmation email, which links to the
same `portalUrl` — they can reply and track the ticket there without any
extra work on your end. Fetch `GET /api/v1/config` to get the current
`category`/`priority` slugs — the set is deployment-specific and
admin-configurable, so don't hardcode it.

> **Your own support page instead of ours.** If this API key has a
> "Customer portal URL" configured (`/admin/api-keys`), `portalUrl` here —
> and every later email link for this ticket (agent replies, closing) —
> points at your own site instead of Docket's built-in `/ticket/:id`
> portal. No response shape change, just a different value.

## `GET /api/v1/tickets/:id`

Look up a ticket's current status — e.g. to show "In Progress" on your own
site without redirecting to the portal.

```bash
curl https://support.example.com/api/v1/tickets/cku1a2b3c4d5e6f \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

**Response** — `200 OK`:

```json
{
  "id": "cku1a2b3c4d5e6f",
  "ticketNumber": 1042,
  "subject": "Cannot log in",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "createdAt": "2026-07-01T10:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-07-02T09:15:00.000Z"
}
```

This endpoint also returns `category`, `priority`, `customerName`,
`customerEmail`, `description`/`descriptionHtml`, `attachments`, and
`customFields` (a flat `{ "<key>": <value> }` map, decoded to native JSON
types — number/boolean/string — matching what you'd send on create); they're
omitted above for brevity.

`404` if the ticket doesn't exist. Any active API key can read any ticket
on your instance — there's no per-key scoping, since a self-hosted
deployment belongs to one owner.

## `GET /api/v1/tickets/:id/attachments/:attachmentId`

Download a single attachment's bytes — e.g. to proxy a file the customer or
an agent uploaded through to your own users, without exposing storage keys.
The attachment must belong to the ticket in the path. This is the endpoint
every `url` field elsewhere in the API (on `GET /tickets/:id` and
`GET /tickets/:id/comments`) points to.

```bash
curl https://support.example.com/api/v1/tickets/cku1a2b3c4d5e6f/attachments/ckw3c4d5e6f7g8h \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -o screenshot.png
```

**Response** — `200 OK`: the raw file bytes, with `Content-Type` set to the
attachment's stored MIME type and `Content-Disposition: attachment` (so a
browser hitting this URL directly downloads rather than navigates). `404`
if the attachment doesn't exist, doesn't belong to that ticket, or the
underlying file is missing from storage.

## `GET /api/v1/tickets/:id/comments`

Read the conversation thread — e.g. to show ticket replies on your own
site, not just its status.

```bash
curl https://support.example.com/api/v1/tickets/cku1a2b3c4d5e6f/comments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

**Response** — `200 OK`:

```json
{
  "comments": [
    {
      "id": "ckv2b3c4d5e6f7g",
      "authorName": "Alex (Support)",
      "authorRole": "agent",
      "content": "Thanks for reaching out — looking into this now.",
      "html": "<p>Thanks for reaching out — looking into this now.</p>",
      "attachments": [],
      "createdAt": "2026-07-01T11:30:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

Only public replies — internal agent notes are never returned, same rule
the customer portal itself enforces. Replies are stored as rich text
internally (bold, lists, links, etc.) — `content` is that flattened to
plain text; `html` renders the same content with formatting intact, safe
to insert into a page (it's generated from our own stored document, not
arbitrary external HTML — only tags the editor itself can produce ever
come out). Use whichever fits where you're displaying it. `attachments` is
an array of `{ id, filename, fileSize, mimeType, url }` — files uploaded
with that specific reply (`url` points to
`GET /tickets/:id/attachments/:attachmentId`); empty if the reply had
none. `404` if the ticket doesn't exist.

## `POST /api/v1/tickets/:id/comments`

Post a reply on behalf of the ticket's customer — e.g. to let them keep
replying from your own product instead of the portal link. The reply is
bound to whichever email the ticket was created with: `email` must match
exactly, so an integrating backend can only reply as the account that
actually owns the ticket (enforcing which of *your* logged-in users maps to
which ticket is your job, not ours).

**Body** (JSON):

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `email` | Yes | Must match the ticket's customer email |
| `content` | Yes | The reply body |
| `contentFormat` | No | `"html"` (default) or `"text"` — note the *opposite* default from ticket creation's `descriptionFormat` |
| `attachments` | No | Same base64 array format as ticket creation, capped at 5 files *total* per ticket (existing attachments count against the cap) |

```bash
curl -X POST https://support.example.com/api/v1/tickets/cku1a2b3c4d5e6f/comments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "content": "Thanks, that fixed it!",
    "contentFormat": "text"
  }'
```

**Response** — `201 Created`:

```json
{ "id": "ckx4d5e6f7g8h9i" }
```

`400` if `email`/`content` is missing, the JSON body is invalid, an
attachment fails validation, or the ticket is closed (reopen it first via
`PATCH /tickets/:id/status`). `403` if `email` doesn't match the ticket's
customer email. `404` if the ticket doesn't exist. `429` if this key has
posted more than 60 replies in a minute.

## `PATCH /api/v1/tickets/:id/status`

Close or reopen a ticket on behalf of its customer — the same action the
"Close"/"Reopen" button does in the customer portal.

**Body** (JSON):

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `email` | Yes | Must match the ticket's customer email |
| `action` | Yes | `"close"` or `"reopen"` |

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://support.example.com/api/v1/tickets/cku1a2b3c4d5e6f/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "email": "jane@example.com", "action": "close" }'
```

**Response** — `200 OK`:

```json
{ "status": "closed" }
```

`status` is the resulting status slug (the platform's configured
closed/default status — resolve its label via `GET /api/v1/config`).
Closing sends the customer the standard "ticket closed" email. `400` if
`email`/`action` is missing or invalid, or the ticket is already in the
requested state (already closed / not closed). `403` if `email` doesn't
match the ticket's customer email. `404` if the ticket doesn't exist.
`429` if this key has made more than 60 status changes in a minute.

## `GET /api/v1/tickets?email=`

List a customer's tickets, most recent first — e.g. to show "Your Tickets"
on your own site.

| Query param | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `email` | Yes | Customer email the tickets were created with |
| `page` | No | 1-indexed page number, default `1` |
| `per_page` | No | Results per page, default `50`, max `100` |

```bash
curl "https://support.example.com/api/v1/tickets?email=jane@example.com&page=1&per_page=50" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

**Response** — `200 OK`:

```json
{
  "tickets": [
    {
      "id": "cku1a2b3c4d5e6f",
      "ticketNumber": 1042,
      "subject": "Cannot log in",
      "status": "in_progress",
      "createdAt": "2026-07-01T10:00:00.000Z",
      "updatedAt": "2026-07-02T09:15:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "perPage": 50,
    "total": 1,
    "totalPages": 1
  }
}
```

`total` is the customer's total ticket count and `totalPages` is
`ceil(total / perPage)` — page through with `page=2`, `page=3`, etc. until
`page >= totalPages`. `400` if `email` is missing, `page` isn't a positive
integer, or `per_page` isn't an integer between 1 and 100. Matches on an
exact, case-sensitive equality against the email the ticket was created
with (same as everywhere else in the app) — an empty `tickets` array just
means no match, not an error.

## What's not supported yet

- **Webhooks** — there's no way yet to get notified when an agent replies
  or a ticket's status changes. Poll `GET /api/v1/tickets/:id/comments` if
  you need that today.
- **A client-side/embeddable widget.** The API is designed to be called
  from your backend, not a browser.
- **Deleting or editing** a reply or attachment once posted.
